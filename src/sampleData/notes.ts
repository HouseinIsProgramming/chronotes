## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers
Use # for different levels:
# H1
## H2
### H3

### Emphasis
*Italic text* or _italic text_
**Bold text** or __bold text__
***Bold and italic***

### Lists
Unordered lists use asterisks, plus, or hyphens:
- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-item
  - Another sub-item

Ordered lists use numbers:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images
[Link text](URL)
![Image alt text](image URL)

### Code
Inline code uses \`backticks\`

Code blocks use triple backticks:
\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
\`\`\`

### Blockquotes
> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines

## Tips
- Keep it simple
- Use preview mode to check formatting
- Practice regularly`,

  reactComponents: {
    title: "React Components Explained",
    content: `# Understanding React Components

## What are Components?

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable pieces of UI that can contain their own content, logic, and styling.

## Types of Components

### 1. Function Components
\`\`\`jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Class Components
\`\`\`jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices
- Keep components focused and small
- Use meaningful names
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## Props vs State
- Props are read-only and passed from parent
- State is internal and managed by the component
- Use state for values that change over time`,

  },
  reactHooks: {
    title: "Essential React Hooks",
    content: `# React Hooks Guide

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Common Hooks

### useState
\`\`\`jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
\`\`\`
Used for managing local state in a component.

### useEffect
\`\`\`jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code here
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code here
  };
}, [dependencies]);
\`\`\`
Used for handling side effects in your components.

### useContext
\`\`\`jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
\`\`\`
Used for consuming context in your components.

## Rules of Hooks
1. Only call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React functions
3. Use the eslint-plugin-react-hooks`,

  asyncAwait: {
    title: "JavaScript Async/Await Guide",
    content: `# Understanding Async/Await in JavaScript

## What is Async/Await?

Async/await is a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way.

## Basic Syntax

\`\`\`javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Key Concepts

1. \`async\` functions always return a Promise
2. \`await\` can only be used inside \`async\` functions
3. Error handling using try/catch

## Common Use Cases

- API calls
- File operations
- Database queries
- Any Promise-based operations

## Best Practices
- Always use try/catch with await
- Avoid callback hell
- Consider Promise.all for parallel operations
- Handle errors appropriately`,
    tags: ["javascript", "async", "programming"],
  },
  javascriptPromises: {
    title: "JavaScript Promises Deep Dive",
    content: `# Understanding JavaScript Promises

## What are Promises?

Promises are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

## Promise States
- Pending: Initial state
- Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully
- Rejected: Operation failed

## Creating Promises

\`\`\`javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (/* operation successful */) {
    resolve(result);
  } else {
    reject(error);
  }
});
\`\`\`

## Promise Methods
- .then() - Handle success
- .catch() - Handle errors
- .finally() - Execute regardless of outcome

## Common Patterns
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(results => {
    // Handle all resolved promises
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any rejection
  });
\`\`\`

## Best Practices
- Always handle rejections
- Chain promises appropriately
- Use Promise.all for parallel operations
- Consider async/await for cleaner code`,
